# Bamazon
This app uses inquirer to allow customers to buy sports drinks and equipment from a make believe supplier and allows an owner to update product inventory listed in a sql database.

In bamazonCustomer.js, the node app will list the available items for purchase in the store and ask the customer what they would like to buy?
